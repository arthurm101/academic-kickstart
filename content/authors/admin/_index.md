 &ensp;  &ensp; &ensp; I'm passionate about humanity's access to space and advancing civilization beyond Earth. Through hardware development, data analysis, and design improvements, I seek to continue contributing to meaningful endeavors to better understand our universe. A future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not.
